//: # Exercise
//: Say that we want to create an output image like this on a 300x300 canvas:
//:
//: ![example](example.png "Example")
//:
//: At first glance this may seem like a complicated image.
//:
//: However, if we break down, or *decompose* the problem, into smaller, more easily completed tasks, it's not so bad.
//:
//: Take a look at this storyboard:
//:
//:![storyboard](storyboard.png "Storyboard")
//:
//: Do you think you could combine:
//: * a single loop
//: * a single statement that draws a line
//:
//: ... to create this image?  Give it a try!
//:
//: ## Required code
//: The following two statements are required to make the playground run. Please do not remove.
import Cocoa
import PlaygroundSupport

//: ## Add your code below

// Create canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 300, height: 300)

// Below this line, try combining a loop and a single statement to generate the goal

for xPos in stride(from: 0, through: 300, by: 20){
    canvas.drawLine(fromX: xPos, fromY: 0, toX: 300, toY: xPos, lineWidth: 1)
}
